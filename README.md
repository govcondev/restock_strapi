# # Shopping Cart

## Project Description
In previous Shopping Cart Exercises products can be added or removed from the shopping cart. This project is more focused on building a restocking function. The program Strapi is used so that the app makes a call back to Strapi to get a fresh list of available products.

### How to Run
**Open the HTML file in your browser**
   - Fork or download the files
   - Open a command line or terminal window and navigate to the root of where the files/folders are
   - Within the same command-line window, run **npm install** to install all dependencies
   - Once the command completes successfully, run **npm start** to start the application in your browser
### Roadmap of Future Improvements 
1. **Continuous Improvements:** Add more creative elements that will further improve the product.
